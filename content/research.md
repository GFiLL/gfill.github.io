How violence during slavery might have affected formerly enslaved families remains an empirically unanswered question. I exploit local variation in enslaved workers' exposure to coercion in two French Caribbean islands: Guadeloupe and Martinique. Using county-level data on enslaved mortality prior to abolition, I document that enslavement conditions were heavily influenced by planters' economic incentives and significantly deteriorated on sugarcane plantations compared to coffee, following heightened competition in the sugar market. I then digitize individual data from handwritten administrative records on all formerly enslaved families that had children five years after abolition. My main finding is that the presence of fathers exposed to the worst conditions during  slavery had a sizable negative effect on the quality of childhood environment, with 40% higher chances of child death respective to families with less coerced or absent fathers. This effect holds regardless of fathers' occupation, place of residence, or mothers' characteristics. I find suggestive evidence that this could be driven by worse enslavement conditions leading to more violent men, to which mothers may have responded through strategic matching decisions with less coerced partners. Taken together, my findings point to substantial inequality among descendants of formerly enslaved individuals. I highlight a yet understudied mechanism of slavery’s legacy: which is that adverse events pass through families – possibly through paternal violence.

 **Slavery and the Roots of Gender-Based Violence in the Caribbean** [Data collection ongoing]

<details>
<summary> <b>Click for abstract </b></summary>
Today, formerly enslaved communities in the Caribbean exhibit high rates of domestic abuse against women (Bott et al., 2012), which some scholars have linked to the sexual exploitation of women during slavery (Davis, 1983; Gautier, 2010). On the other hand, black women in the US have consistently showed higher rates of labor force participation compared to white women, which could stem from the fact that men and women shared equal labor responsibilities during slavery (Goldin, 1977; Browne, 1997). The relationship between exposure to slavery and gender equality is, therefore, unclear. This paper focuses on the French Caribbean context and examine whether violence during slavery affected violence against black women, gender norms, and female labor force participation across several generations. To measure violence against women, I exploit individual level information on French West Indies criminals sent to the penal colony of Guyana from 1848 to 1950. I also exploit civil registries from 1848 to 1905 to study female labor force participation and contemporary survey data on violence against women.

 **Planters' Individual Effect on Violence during Slavery** [Data collection ongoing]

This paper adds to our understanding of the determinants of the experience of slavery. While previous historical work has highlighted the importance of structural determinants (crops) (Smith, 1982), I investigate the specific individual effect of slave owners, whose power over enslaved workers was unlimited. I focus on the French West Indies, where slavery was abolished in 1848. I exploit information from administrative archival records on enslaved death and birth, which I digitize at the individual level, as well as trial reports of planters judged for torture or murder, to identify the “deadliest” plantations.
