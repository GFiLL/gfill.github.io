This paper examines the effects of Free College policies on student enrollment and academic performance, with a focus on the 2016 Chilean reform that granted tuition-free higher education to students from the lowest five income deciles. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that Free College increased enrollment and persistence in higher education but had modest effects on graduation and dropout rates. To disentangle the role of student effort from selection effects, we develop a structural model in which students choose effort levels in response to financial incentives. Our results highlight that Free College expanded access, in particular for low-achieving students. Despite the removal of academic progress requirements, we found no evidence of weakening performance.

Returns to education literature has focused on the choice of major and years of schooling, but vocational education tracks have attracted less attention. In this paper, we study how the type of post-secondary education (general vs. vocational) affects occupational choices and wages in Germany. To do so, we develop a dynamic model of education and occupation choices, accounting for unobserved multidimensional ability. We find that after controlling for sorting of individuals with high cognitive ability in general tracks, non-cognitive ability can explain heterogeneity in wages.
